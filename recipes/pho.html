<h2> You DO NOT need trek wide and far to a Vietnamese neighbourhood to get your Vietnamese sandwich fix!</h2>
<p> 
    Fellow Banh Mi lovers, this one’s for you! A recipe that’s been in the works for a very long time, with much taste-testing research done (it’s hard work, but someone’s gotta do it… 😂).
</p>
<p>Serve it over vermicelli noodles with Vietnamese Nuoc Cham Sauce and your fresh vegetables of choice.</p>
